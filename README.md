### First Time Setup

#### Omise Keys Setup

In order to make a charge with Omise, you have to link the store to your Omise account by using your [credentials](https://www.omise.co/api-authentication) (public and secret keys):

1. At the admin top bar menu. Click `Omise > Keys Setting`. You will be redirected to the Omise module setting page.
2. In this page you can set your `Omise Keys`. Anyway if you want to test Omise service integration, you can enable *test mode* by clicking `Enable test mode`. Your Magento will then process orders with your test keys.
    <p align="center"><a alt="omise-magento-keys-setup-01" href='https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2154669/23207427/d9a3da98-f923-11e6-9e4a-3b588be9b0d8.png'><img title="omise-magento-install-manual-04" src='https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2154669/23207427/d9a3da98-f923-11e6-9e4a-3b588be9b0d8.png' /></a></p>

#### Enabling Omise Module

In order to enable **Omise Payment Gateway** in the checkout page, you have to enable the module from Magento's configuration page, at the payment method section.  

1. At the admin top bar menu. Click `Omise > Module Setting`. You will be redirected to the Magento's payment method configuration page.
2. At the bottommost of the page, you will see `Omise Payment Gateway` section with 2 payment methods, Credit Card and [Internet Banking](https://www.omise.co/offsite-payment).  
    To enable the Omise Payment Gateway, choose one (or both) and then, set the option `Enabled` to `Yes` to activate the payment method and save the config. 
    <p align="center"><a alt="omise-magento-enable-module-01" href='https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2154669/26388922/50f6cdcc-4081-11e7-8ee8-f525e5d3a1ad.png'><img title="omise-magento-enable-module-01" src='https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2154669/26388922/50f6cdcc-4081-11e7-8ee8-f525e5d3a1ad.png' /></a></p>

In some business models you may need to capture the charge at a later time.  
For example, when you can capture the charge only when you have the product in stock or before shipping. In that case, during checkout Omise will only authorize and hold the charge.  

> _You can hold a charge for as long as permitted by the issuing bank. This delay may vary between cards from 1 to 30 days depending on each card._

The 2 available options for **Payment Action** are `Authorize only` or `Authorize and Capture`.

And, other option is **New order status**, which can be set to `Pending` or `Processing` status. Your order status after checkout process will be set depends on the option here.
